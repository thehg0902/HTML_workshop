            The Sengoku Era was a century-long period in Japanese history that was known for its military
            conflict among social and political upheaval. Warlords ruled, and of the country's leaders fought
            each other in a never-ending battle to claim both power and land. This was also the era known as the
            Middle Ages, and the more medieval setting allowed for the impression that various ancient and mystical
            elements still exist in the world.

          LIFE OF Sekiro
          <div class="details">

              style="height:auto; max-width:100%; width:500px;float:right;">
              In the aftermath of the deciding battle, master shinobi Owl came across a small child. When the child
              calmly grabs his blade after Owl draws it across his face, Owl is impressed by his fortitude and takes
              him in as his own son, naming him "Wolf." Training the child over twenty years in the ways of shinobi,
              Owl assigns him the duty of protecting his new master: Kuro, a child and descendant of an ancient and
              mystical bloodline. As Owl departs he reminds him of the shinobi iron code: his father's rule is absolute;
              his master's rule is a close second; and, in the event of his master being kidnapped or placed under threat,
              he must protect and return him at any cost.

          Protecting Kuro

              style="height: auto;max-width: 100%; width:300px;float:left;padding:10px">
              Some twenty years after Isshin's coup, and over three years after Wolf began protecting Kuro,
              the Ashina clan is on the brink of collapse. With multiple impending threats putting the Ashina Castle at risk,
              the Ashina clan kidnaps Kuro the Divine Heir. Aware that Kuro's oath can grant immortality, the Ashina clan is
              keen to exploit said powers in the hope it will secure their hold on both the region.
              <br>
              </br>
              Sekiro makes his way through the castle grounds, navigating the rooftops and battling through Ashina Castle's
              samurai and shinobi in the process. Reaching the peak of the castle, Wolf overhears Emma telling Genichiro that
              Lord Isshin does not have long to live. With Isshin's reputation being a significant protection for Ashina,
              Genichiro pleads with Kuro to take him under his oath, hoping to use the immortality it grants to protect the clan;
              since the Divine Heir cannot be maimed with conventional weapons and he won't accept him under his oath, Genichiro is stuck at an impasse.

          Immortality Severance

                Speaking with Kuro, Wolf learns that he wishes to find a way to sever his immortality,
                believing that people will always pursue him as long as he holds The Dragon's Heritage.
                Refusing to break the iron code but remaining loyal, Wolf agrees to help Kuro explore
                different options. Researching old documents in the tower, Kuro discovers a possible
                lead in the diaries of a previous Divine Heir that also pursued Immortal Severance.

              Wolf approaches a seriously injured Kuro, and feeds him the Dragon Tears. To then fulfil his request,
              Wolf stabs Kuro with the Mortal Blade, killing him. In the aftermath Wolf returns to the Dilapidated
              Temple as the Sculptor's replacement, having similarly relinquished his prosthetic to carve Buddha
              statues. Wolf is then approached by Emma, who gifts him the old prosthesis and suggests he hold the
              arm for the next Shinobi seeking strength.
